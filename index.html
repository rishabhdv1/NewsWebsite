                <p>Ahead of the commencement of the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha, Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent out a terse message to the Congress-led Opposition that people of the country expect "debate and diligence" from members of the parliament, not “disturbance”. Addressing the media outside the new Parliament building, PM Modi said the masses want substance from MPs, not slogans, and he has full faith that the latter will fulfill the expectations of the common man.</p>
                <p>"India needs a responsible Opposition. People want substance not slogans, they want debate, diligence not disturbance in Parliament. People expect good steps from the Opposition.

                <p>The 2024 edition of the T20 World Cup confirmed its first pair of semifinalists on Monday after the Super Eight stage of the tournament completed its share of matches for Group 2. Defending champions England, who were on the verge of a humiliating group-stage elimination last week, qualified for the Super Eight with the help of Australia's win over Scotland, before beating West Indies and the USA to secure the semifinal spot for the fourth time in a row in T20 World Cups. Later, in Antigua, South Africa survived the nail-biter against the Windies to secure their first semifinal qualification since 2014 and third overall. But for the Indian audience, the burning question stands - whom will Rohit Sharma's men face in the semis, should they beat Australia on Monday?</p>

                <p>TOKYO — The word “onigiri” became part of the Oxford English Dictionary this year, proof that the humble sticky-rice ball and mainstay of Japanese food has entered the global lexicon.</p>
                <p>The rice balls are stuffed with a variety of fillings and typically wrapped in seaweed. It's an everyday dish that epitomizes “washoku” — the traditional Japanese cuisine that was designated a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage a decade ago.</p>
                <p>Onigiri is “fast food, slow food and soul food,” says Yusuke Nakamura, who heads the Onigiri Society, a trade group in Tokyo.</p>
                <p>Fast because you can find it even at convenience stores. Slow because it uses ingredients from the sea and mountains, he said. And soul food because it's often made and consumed among family and friends. No tools are needed, just gently cupped hands.</p>
                <p>“It’s also mobile, food on the move,” he said.</p>
                <p>Onigiri in its earliest form is believed to go back at least as far as the early 11th Century; it's mentioned in Murasaki Shikibu’s “The Tale of Genji.” It appears in Akira Kurosawa’s classic 1954 film “Seven Samurai” as the ultimate gift of gratitude from the farmers. What exactly goes into onigiri?</p>
